# Create-images
Generating images using [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

## Most of the pre-processing and plotting the images codes are borrowed from [CS231n](https://cs231n.github.io/) assignment3

## Dependencies:
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Pytorch
  * TorchVision
## Dataset:
  * CIFAR-10 (32x32x3) shape
